# ArtConnect ReadMe

## Introduction

Welcome to ArtConnect, your go-to platform for connecting local artists with small businesses. This Python-based application aims to foster collaboration between artists and businesses, allowing them to showcase their talents, discover exciting projects, and build lasting partnerships.

## Features

### 1. Artist Profiles

Artists can create and personalize their profiles, providing a snapshot of their skills, experience, and contact information. The profile also serves as a canvas for artists to showcase their previous work, giving businesses a glimpse of their artistic style.

### 2. Business Profiles

Small businesses can create profiles detailing their requirements, location, and contact information. They can browse through artist portfolios to find the perfect match for their projects.

### 3. Project Requests

Businesses can submit project requests, specifying the type of artwork they need and any other relevant details. Artists receive these requests and can express their interest in collaborating on the project.

### 4. Collaboration Hub

Once a project is confirmed, artists and businesses can communicate through a dedicated collaboration hub. This facilitates smooth discussions, file sharing, and progress updates throughout the project.

### 5. Rating and Review System

Both artists and businesses have the opportunity to rate and review each other upon project completion. This system helps build a trustworthy community and provides valuable feedback for continuous improvement.
